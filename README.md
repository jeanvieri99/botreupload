# BOTREUPLOAD

Dear HR Team,

This is a server side file of Discord Bot with Node.js.
The main function of this server is to let Discord users play music from Youtube through this bot so the other users in voice channel can hear the same music.

I hide some API Key due security issue, as the effect the bot wouldn't work.
